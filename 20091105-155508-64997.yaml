  body: "Some people do not care about \"assigning\" dropdown. For those ignorant dudes the \"Save\" button should simply be \"reassign to responsible guy\" or \"reply\".\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In other words, there are two fields: \"task responsible\" and \"comment recipients\"\r\n\
    So here is the requirement:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x94 system should preserve \"assigned to\" marker across the conversation, it should not be treated like a person upon whom the work is blocked;\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x94 at the same time, for the commentor there should be a track of unanswered comments (or tasks related to unanswered comments), as well there should be a track of comments awaiting your reply.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Finally, you have three groups of pending tasks:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    a) tasks assigned to you which are not blocked by any request\r\n\
    b) tasks assigned to you which are blocked by request to someone else\r\n\
    c) other tasks blocked by request for your activity\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x94 the top priority is (c) since it requires your activity and affects both you and the other guy\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x94 second priority is (a) since it also requires your activity\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x94 last priority is (b) since it is doesn't require your activity\r\n"
