      The interesting case is to store tasks inside the regular repository (in a detached branch, probably). 
      
      The working tree for this branch should be located in .git/ampoule/
      
      1) init: to avoid full repository clone into .git/ampoule (which consumes disk space and cpu time), we should create a shallow clone of the current repository and update config
      
      2) pull: fetch the special branch "ampoule-tasks"; then merge it to the local ampoule-tasks branch
