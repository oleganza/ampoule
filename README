ABOUT

Ampoule is a minimal bug tracker based on Git.

You will be asked for a repository URL if it could not be guessed from .git/config
Tasks are stored in a human-readable YAML format in a separate branch "ampoule-tasks". 
Your development history is never polluted with ampoule commits.

Features:
