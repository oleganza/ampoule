ABOUT

Ampoule is a minimal bug tracker based on Git.

To start, run ampoule executable inside any git repository. 
You will be asked for a writable URL if it could not be guessed from .git/config
Tasks are stored in a human-readable YAML format in a separate branch "ampoule-tasks". 
Your development history is never polluted with ampoule commits.

Features:
  open/close tasks, assign to people and set priorities
  comments for tasks
  offline work: tasks are stored in your project's repository
  autosync: updates are commited and pushed immediately, git pull is performed every 2-3 seconds
