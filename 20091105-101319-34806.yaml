    First, it should fcgi script to be served by Apache, which is the most easy solution. Preferably, the same script used standalone.
    
    Authentication info should be stored inside git repo, so anyone can fix auth issue if it happens.

     $ man git-commit-tree
    
               GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
               GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
               GIT_AUTHOR_DATE
               GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
               GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
               GIT_COMMITTER_DATE
               EMAIL
